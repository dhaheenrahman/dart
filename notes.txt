entry point:- 
	main function

	void main(){
		print("Hello World!");
	}

Comments:-
	Single line ->  // comment goes here
	Multi line ->  /* comment goes here */

Built in data-types:-
	Numbers
		int,double
	Strings
	Booleans
	Lists
	Maps
	Runes
	Symbols

	Note:- All dataypes are objects. Default value will be 'null'.
		If we use var, the datatypes is inferred based on the value

	declaration:-
		<datatype> <variable_name> = <value>
	Eg:
		int age = 10;
		String name = "John";
		bool isALive = true;
		var age = 10;	here age is inferred as integer automatically.
		String s1 = 'Single';
		String s2 = "double";
		String s3 = 'It\'s easy';
		String s4 = "It's easy";
		String s5 = 'This is a very long string.'
			     'This is the remaining part of s5';
		for the above string s5, we can either use '+' or just write as given above.
 

final and const keywords:-

	both are used for defining constant values which cannot be changed further.
	final is initialized only when accessed in code
	const is initialized when we compile the code
	instance variable can only be final. If we want to make it const, use 'static const'.

	Eg: final name = "JOHN";
		or
	    final String name = "JOHN";

	    const PI = 3.14;

String Interpolation:-
	Eg:
	String name = "John";
	print("My name is " + name);
	or
	print("My name is $name");	\\ This is the String interpolation

	print("Sum of $a and $b is ${a + b}");

List(Array):-
	1.fixed size
		/* List<int> arr = List(5);	
		or
		var arr = List(5);

		accessing elements:
			arr[0] = 5;
			arr[3] = 8; */
	2.growable List
		List<String> ls = [];	//size increase dynamically
		or
		List<String> ls = ["CANADA","USA"];

		operation on growable list:
			arr.add(5);		//element 5 will be added at the last index
			arr.remove(5);	//element 5 will be deleted from the list and index will get adjusted automatically for the remaining elementsl
			arr.removeAt(2)	//element at index 2 will be removed
			arr.clear()		//all the elements will get deleted
